abstract = {Increasingly complex and autonomous systems require machine ethics to maximize the
benefits and minimize the risks to society arising from the new technology. It is
challenging to decide which type of ethical theory to employ and how to implement
it effectively. This survey provides a threefold contribution. First, it introduces
a trimorphic taxonomy to analyze machine ethics implementations with respect to their
object (ethical theories), as well as their nontechnical and technical aspects. Second,
an exhaustive selection and description of relevant works is presented. Third, applying
the new taxonomy to the selected works, dominant research patterns, and lessons for
the field are identified, and future directions for research are suggested.},
